LibGDXAtlasParser

LibGDXAtlasParser is a parser for Atlas files generated by LibGDX's texture packer Classes and nightly jar file.
It allows you to read Atlas files through a series of dictionary trees similar to XMLtree objects. The first
tree is allows a root tree that contains all subtrees or child tree of the file. Each child represents a section in
the Atlas file. Each section can have keys and child trees/subsections.

TODO:

*Check keys are imported correctly
*Check that a empty newline is not required at the end of the file
	*If a newline is required simply add one when End of file is reached
*Check other debug requirements
