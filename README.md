## LibGDX-Atlas-Parser
This is a LibGDX Texture Atlas Parser. There is also a project for [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/)/[Monogame Extended](github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended) content importer. It was an initial prototype. This was abandoned because there are other LibGDX-Atlas importers like NEZ (https://github.com/prime31/Nez).
